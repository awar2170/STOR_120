    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a classmate or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",
